# cpp-platformer
 
Simple platformer written in C++ using the Raylib game development library. Go check out [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)!

Features a finite state machine, which keeps track of current and nested states. 

## Progress

`04/20/21` Playing around with Raylib, created Player class. <br>
`04/25/21` Finally figured out how C++ does seperate header and implementation files<br>
`05/01/21` Created base state classes and working finite state machine for game states<br>
`05/10/21` Created menu and play states, integrated Player into game<br>
`05/18/21` Implemented basic box collision and resolved issues<br>
`05/24/21` Implemented alternative box collision algorithm that works much better<br>
